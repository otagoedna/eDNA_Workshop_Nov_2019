# Updates

### Student talks

We will be having *Lightning Round* presentations of five minute talks, for those who have preliminary or proposed data to present, and do not need the full time. Please indicate *Lightning* on your abstract submission or just [email me](mailto:hugh.cross@otago.ac.nz) which format you prefer. This is open to anyone.

### Deadlines approaching!

**Please submit abstracts by 25th October.** You can use the EasyChair website, or just [email me](mailto:hugh.cross@otago.ac.nz).

**Early bird registration ends 25th October.** [Go to this link](https://events.humanitix.co.nz/environmental-dna-workshop), or head to the [registration page](registration_info.md).

**There are limited spaces for Metabarcoding course**, so better to sign up sooner than later. We will try to accommodate everyone.

### Conference Dinner

We will be having a conference dinner on the evening of the 26th (first day of symposium). There is no extra cost. It is included in the registration fee.

### Meeting Overview

The [Otago eDNA Research Group](https://otagoedna.github.io/) at the [University of Otago](https://www.otago.ac.nz/) will be hosting a meeting to bring together researchers at all levels to discuss research on metabarcoding and environmental DNA. Invited speakers from across Australia and New Zealand will present their research. We will soon open the site to receive abstracts for anyone interested in sharing their research. As well, a course on new bioinformatic methods in metabarcoding will be taught on the last day. This event is scheduled for 25-28th of November, 2019.

**Objective of Meeting**

The aim of the meeting is to catch up on aspects of environmental DNA, focusing on metabarcoding and metagenomic methods. We hope this will be a good opportunity for students from New Zealand and Australia to catch up on the latest developments, meet with leaders in the field, and also to present their own research. We are currently planning eight sessions of talks spread over two days, with each led by an experienced researcher.

## Preliminary Schedule 

A symposium will be held on the 26th and 27th of November, covering a wide range of topics. On the 28th an all-day course will be given on bioinformatic methods for metabarcoding data. The 25th of November will be an optional day for students and researchers that need to learn basic bioinformatic tools (command line and R) that will be needed for the Metabarcoding course. 

Day | Title |
----|-----|
25 November | Intro to Bioinformatic Tools for Metabarcoding |
26 November | Environmental DNA Symposium, Day 1 |
27 November | Environmental DNA Symposium, Day 2 |
28 November | Bioinformatic Methods in Metabarcoding Course |

**More details will be coming soon!**
